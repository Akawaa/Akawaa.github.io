            I've had a long-standing desire to pursue game development due to my passion for video games. 
            In the middle of my degree, I embarked on my game development journey, where I learned Unity and 
            extensively researched serious gamesâ€”a genre of video games designed to educate users on various topics.

            <br/><br/>

            In one of my classes, I conducted in-depth research on serious games, which culminated in a 
            20-page <a href = "Final_Report_Project_1.pdf" target = "_blank" className="paragraph-link">report</a>. 
            For my own serious game project, I decided to create a game aimed at teaching programming fundamentals to kids. 
            I've diligently documented my progress in another <a href = "project2_final.pdf" target = "_blank" className="paragraph-link">report</a>, 
            and I hope to present a complete demo soon.

            <br/><br/>

            Creating this game has been a tremendous learning experience for me, and it fuels my excitement to continue 
            working on it until I have a finished product. Additionally, I've been teaching myself Blender to eventually have the ability to create my own models once my skills are proficient enough.
